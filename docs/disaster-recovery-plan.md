# Disaster Recovery Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the disaster recovery procedures for the Head AI system. The plan ensures business continuity in the event of system failures, data loss, or other catastrophic events.

## Recovery Objectives

- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: 4 hours
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: 1 hour
- **Service Level Agreement**: 99.95% uptime

## Backup Strategy

### Full Backups
- Frequency: Daily (midnight UTC)
- Components:
  - PostgreSQL database
  - Redis cache
  - Application files
  - Configuration files
- Retention: 30 days
- Storage: AWS S3 (cross-region replication)

### Incremental Backups
- Frequency: Every 6 hours
- Components:
  - Database changes
  - New application files
- Retention: 7 days

### Transaction Logs
- Frequency: Every 15 minutes
- Components:
  - Database transaction logs
- Retention: 24 hours

## Recovery Procedures

### Level 1: Single Component Failure

1. **Database Failure**
   ```bash
   # Stop application
   systemctl stop headai

   # Restore database
   python scripts/backup/recovery_manager.py config/backup.json --component database

   # Verify database
   python scripts/backup/test_recovery.py --test database

   # Start application
   systemctl start headai
   ```

2. **Redis Failure**
   ```bash
   # Stop Redis
   systemctl stop redis

   # Restore Redis data
   python scripts/backup/recovery_manager.py config/backup.json --component redis

   # Start Redis
   systemctl start redis
   ```

3. **File System Failure**
   ```bash
   # Stop application
   systemctl stop headai

   # Restore files
   python scripts/backup/recovery_manager.py config/backup.json --component files

   # Start application
   systemctl start headai
   ```

### Level 2: Multiple Component Failure

1. Stop all services:
   ```bash
   systemctl stop headai redis postgresql
   ```

2. Restore all components:
   ```bash
   python scripts/backup/recovery_manager.py config/backup.json --full-recovery
   ```

3. Verify recovery:
   ```bash
   python scripts/backup/test_recovery.py --full
   ```

4. Start services:
   ```bash
   systemctl start postgresql redis headai
   ```

### Level 3: Complete System Failure

1. **Infrastructure Recovery**
   - Deploy new infrastructure using Terraform
   - Verify network connectivity
   - Configure security groups

2. **System Recovery**
   - Install system dependencies
   - Configure system services
   - Restore SSL certificates

3. **Data Recovery**
   - Download backups from S3
   - Restore all components
   - Verify data integrity

4. **Application Recovery**
   - Deploy application code
   - Configure application
   - Start services
   - Run system tests

## Disaster Recovery Sites

### Primary Site (US East)
- Region: us-east-1
- Services: All components
- Backup Storage: headai-backups-primary

### Secondary Site (US West)
- Region: us-west-2
- Services: Critical components
- Backup Storage: headai-backups-secondary

## Failover Procedures

### To Secondary Site
1. Update DNS records
2. Restore data from cross-region backups
3. Start services in secondary region
4. Verify system functionality
5. Update monitoring configuration

### Back to Primary Site
1. Sync data from secondary to primary
2. Verify data integrity
3. Update DNS records
4. Verify system functionality
5. Restore original monitoring configuration

## Testing Procedures

### Regular Testing
- Monthly recovery tests
- Quarterly failover tests
- Annual disaster simulation

### Test Scenarios
1. Single component recovery
2. Full system recovery
3. Cross-region failover
4. Data integrity verification
