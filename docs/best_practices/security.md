# Security Best Practices

## API Authentication

### API Keys
- Never hardcode API keys in your code
- Use environment variables or secure configuration management
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use different API keys for development and production

### JWT Tokens
- Use short-lived tokens
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Include necessary claims
- Validate tokens on every request

## Data Protection

### Encryption
- Use TLS 1.3 for data in transit
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use strong encryption algorithms (AES-256)
- Implement proper key management

### Data Handling
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Validate data types and formats
- Implement rate limiting
- Use parameterized queries

## Access Control

### Role-Based Access
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Define clear role hierarchies
- Regular access reviews
- Audit access changes

### IP Restrictions
- Whitelist allowed IP ranges
- Block suspicious IPs
- Monitor access patterns
- Use VPN for admin access

## Monitoring & Logging

### Security Monitoring
- Enable audit logging
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Set up alerts for security events
- Regular security scans

### Incident Response
- Have an incident response plan
- Document security incidents
- Regular security drills
- Update security measures

## Code Security

### Dependencies
- Regular dependency updates
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Lock dependency versions
- Use private package registry

### Code Review
- Mandatory security reviews
- Automated security testing
- Code signing
- Secure deployment process

## Infrastructure Security

### Network Security
- Use WAF (Web Application Firewall)
- DDoS protection
- Network segmentation
- Regular security audits

### Cloud Security
- Follow cloud provider best practices
- Enable cloud security features
- Regular infrastructure scans
- Backup critical data

## Compliance

### Standards
- Follow industry standards (OWASP)
- Regular compliance audits
- Document compliance measures
- Train team on compliance

### Privacy
- GDPR compliance
- Data minimization
- Privacy by design
- Regular privacy impact assessments
