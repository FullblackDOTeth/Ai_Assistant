# Development Log

## 2024-12-14T18:00:52-05:00 - Initial Project Setup
### Added Files
- Created project directory structure
- Created README.md with project overview
- Created initial assistant.py with base class structure
- Created requirements.txt with core dependencies

### Implementation Details
1. Set up basic project structure with the following directories:
   - src/: For source code
   - docs/: For documentation
   - models/: For ML models
   - data/: For training data
   - logs/: For runtime logs

2. Implemented basic AIAssistant class with:
   - Voice recognition placeholder
   - NLP engine placeholder
   - ML analyzer placeholder
   - Context management placeholder

### Next Steps
1. Implement voice recognition system
2. Set up NLP pipeline
3. Implement machine learning components
4. Add real-time web access capabilities
5. Develop context management system

### Notes
- The project is structured to be scalable and maintainable
- Each component is designed to be modular for easy updates and modifications
- Documentation will be maintained with timestamps for all changes

## 2024-12-14T18:08:28-05:00 - Environment Setup
### Development Environment
1. Created Python virtual environment
2. Required dependencies to be installed:
   - Core ML libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch
   - Voice Recognition: SpeechRecognition, PyAudio
   - NLP: Transformers, spaCy, NLTK
   - Utilities: Requests, aiohttp, python-dotenv, tqdm

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools (for PyAudio)
- Sufficient disk space for ML libraries

### Next Steps
1. Activate virtual environment
2. Install dependencies using pip
3. Verify installations

## 2024-12-14T19:42:55-05:00 - Local Environment Configuration
### Changes Made
1. Created `.env` file to manage project paths and configurations
2. Updated `assistant.py` to use local project paths
3. Created `setup_nltk.py` for managing NLTK data locally
4. Configured all data to be stored in `E:\Head Ai` directory structure:
   - `data/`: For storing training data and NLTK data
   - `models/`: For storing trained models
   - `logs/`: For application logs
   - `src/`: For source code
   - `docs/`: For documentation

### Next Steps
1. Run NLTK setup script to download required language data
2. Implement voice recognition module
3. Set up machine learning components
4. Configure real-time web access

### Notes
- All project dependencies and data will be kept within the `E:\Head Ai` directory
- Each component is configured to use local paths for better portability
- Development logs are being maintained with timestamps for tracking changes

## 2024-12-14T19:51:57-05:00 - UI Implementation
### Changes Made
1. Created `ui.py` with a modern GUI interface using customtkinter
2. Updated `assistant.py` to integrate with the UI
3. Added text-to-text generation using the BlenderBot model
4. Implemented conversation history saving

### Features Added
- Modern dark-themed UI
- Text input with send button
- Voice input button (placeholder)
- Conversation history with timestamps
- Automatic conversation saving
- Multi-threaded response handling

### Next Steps
1. Implement voice recognition functionality
2. Add more sophisticated NLP processing
3. Implement machine learning analysis features
4. Add real-time web access capabilities

### Notes
- The UI is designed to be user-friendly and responsive
- All conversations are automatically saved in the logs directory
- The system uses multi-threading to prevent UI freezing during processing

## 2024-12-14T19:54:07-05:00 - UI Enhancement: Comic Style Chat Bubbles
### Changes Made
1. Redesigned UI with comic-style chat bubbles
2. Added custom ChatBubble widget class
3. Improved visual styling with rounded corners and better colors
4. Enhanced user experience with better spacing and layout

### Visual Improvements
- Comic-style chat bubbles with rounded corners
- Different colors for user (blue) and assistant (gray) messages
- Timestamps and sender names in each bubble
- Improved input field with rounded corners
- Better button styling with hover effects
- Dark theme with better contrast
- Scrollable chat container

### Technical Improvements
- Better message wrapping for long texts
- Improved layout management
- Enhanced visual feedback for voice recording
- Better handling of window resizing

### Next Steps
1. Add bubble tail/pointer for more comic-like appearance
2. Implement animations for message appearance
3. Add support for rich content (images, code blocks)
4. Implement voice recognition visualization
