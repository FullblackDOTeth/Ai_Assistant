# Getting Started with Head AI

## Overview
Head AI is a powerful platform that combines advanced artificial intelligence capabilities with robust security and performance features. This guide will help you get started with integrating Head AI into your applications.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- API key from Head AI dashboard

## Installation

1. Install the Head AI package:
```bash
pip install headai
```

2. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
export HEADAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
export HEADAI_ENV=production
```

## Quick Start

1. Initialize the Head AI client:
```python
from headai import Client

client = Client(api_key="your_api_key_here")
```

2. Make your first API call:
```python
# Get AI model predictions
response = client.predict(
    model="text-analysis",
    input="Your text here"
)

print(response.predictions)
```

## Authentication

Head AI uses API keys for authentication. You can obtain your API key from the Head AI dashboard:

1. Log in to your Head AI account
2. Navigate to Settings > API Keys
3. Click "Generate New Key"
4. Copy and securely store your API key

Include your API key in requests:
```python
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {api_key}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
```
